\caption{kinematic distributions: Top left, $\mathrm{``\xi\;vs\;x''}$ distribution for all events in black, Red and Green square
are two representative bins that were used to study BSA. The Top right plot shows the ``$\mathrm{ Q^{'2}\;vs\;Q^{2}}$'' distributions
for kinematic bins shown in Top-Left plot. In addition for each ``$\mathrm{\xi\;vs\;x}$'' bin, the ``$\mathrm{ Q^{'2}\;vs\;Q^{2}}$''
phase space is divided into two regions (highlihted by different colors).
Bottom-Left plot showsn ``$\mathrm{ x_{B}\;vs\;t}$'' distriutions for both selected bins in the Top-left plot, lower $\mathrm{x_{B}}$ region
corresponds to lower x bin. The bottom right plot shows ``$\mathrm{\theta\;vs\;p}$'' distributions for electrons. Black dots represent
the phase space for all events in the $\mathrm{e^{-}\mu^{-}\mu^{+}}$ final state, while regions with different colors correspond to
different ``$\mathrm{ Q^{'2}\;vs\;Q^{2}}$'' distributions. Color coding is the same as the one on Top-right plot.}
